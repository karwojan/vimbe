Inspect codex/codex-rs/core/src/protocol.rs file and imported files if necessary to familiarize with all types definitions, related to Event. Then edit python3/codex_protocol_event.py file and create EventMessage subclasses for each found event type. Create any necessary enums or any other helper dataclasses, to create complete mirror of all event messsage types. Then implement `from_dict` method of EventMessage class to create proper event message subtype from input dictionary, which is loaded from json representing answer from codex proto. In the `from_dict` method implementation handle all the created event message subtypes.
