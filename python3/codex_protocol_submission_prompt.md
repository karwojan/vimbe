Inspect codex/codex-rs/core/src/protocol.rs file and imported files if necessary to familiarize with all types definitions, related to Submission. Then edit python3/codex_protocol_submission.py file and create SubmissionOperation subclass for each found submmission op type. Create any necessary enums or any other helper dataclasses, to create complete mirror of all submission operations types. Each created dataclass should provide `to_dict` method, which, when parsed to json, should provide json representation of the submission operation, according to its original Rust implementation.
